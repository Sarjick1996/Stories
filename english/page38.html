My Dominant Elder Sister

</small>

<p>


Short sex game between sister and brother -
Didi went and stood under the shower. I took the soap and slowly rubbed it on Didi's back. Didi's back was very soft. I couldn't control my desire and then... Didi went and stood under the shower. I took the soap and slowly rubbed it on Didi's back. Didi's back was very soft. I couldn't control my desire and then... Ruma came and started rubbing Paltu's pussy, saying "What! I asked you to take off your shirt and pants and be naked, and you are still wearing pants?"
Paltu said "Didi, it was Rimi, I didn't do that"

Ruma got angry and grabbed Paltu's pants and pulled them down and took him by the hand and dragged him into the bathroom. "Don't come too often Paltu, you will do what you are told to do!" Paltu's sister was wearing a saree, Paltu could see her chest through the gap in her blouse.
He said to Didi, "Never again, Didi."

Didi took off her saree, saya and blouse, and told her, "Come on! Apply some cream on me."

Didi went and stood under the shower. Paltu took the cream and started applying it slowly on Didi's back. Ruma's back was very soft. Paltu couldn't control his greed. He went a little further and pressed his penis between her soft buttocks and continued applying cream on Didi's hands and back. Didi didn't say anything. Paltu felt very comfortable. He said to Didi, "Didi, come forward now, I'll apply cream on your front."

Ruma turned to Paltu. Paltu slowly started from her shoulders and went down to her chest. The two brown dots on Didi's big swollen chest had hardened. Paltu started massaging Didi's stomach instead of her chest. Didi smeared some Shaban on both hands and applied it to Paltu's chest.

Didi said, "Your pussy has hardened!"
Paltu said, "Shall I massage your breasts, Didi?"
Didi got angry and grabbed Paltu's pussy and started pulling it hard and said, "Yes, you bastard, massage them well. And yes, no matter how hard I squeeze your pussy, you won't drop it, but if you drop it, I will beat you very badly!"

Paltu said in fear, ‚ÄúAh! Didi, don‚Äôt shout so loudly.‚Äù
Didi then started to stroke his penis even more loudly, saying, ‚ÄúI will do whatever I want with your penis, do what I tell you to do.‚Äù
Helplessly, Paltu kept massaging Didi‚Äôs chest, but Didi was rubbing it so hard that at one point, unable to stand, Paltu leaned on Didi‚Äôs body. ‚ÄúDidi! Ah!! If you do this, my money will come out, Didi!‚Äù

Didi didn‚Äôt say anything, she just grabbed her pussy and started slapping Paltu‚Äôs ass. Paltu shouted, ‚ÄúAh! Didi, I feel it.‚Äù But Didi didn‚Äôt listen to anything Paltu said, and kept hitting her with her pussy. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do it again Didi, I will do whatever you say this time, please Didi‚Äù, Didi didn‚Äôt listen to any of Paltu‚Äôs pleas. Sitting on the bathroom floor, she grabbed his cock and pulled him onto her lap, pressed his hard cock into her soft thighs and started spanking him. Paltu‚Äôs screams were drowned out by the sound of the shower. Paltu‚Äôs pleasure was drowned out by the sound of the shower. Didi beat Paltu with pleasure and told him to lie down. As soon as he lay down, Didi sat on his face and squeezed her pussy. Before he could do anything, she grabbed his pussy again and started spanking him.

Didi said, ‚ÄúYou bastard, suck it well, if you suck like your grandfather, I will suffocate you to death‚Äù

Paltu stuck his tongue into Didi‚Äôs pussy in fear. Ruma let out a soothing sound and pressed Paltu's mouth harder, and his penis started to thrust harder. Paltu continued to comfort Didi's vagina as much as he could. After a while, Didi started to move her ass vigorously. She also started to squeeze her nipples equally.

"Ah! You suck so well! Ah! Now I'll release the water, don't eat my juice!", Didi moved her plump ass and released the juice on Paltu's face.

After being trapped under Didi for a while, Ruma got off her face, then said to Paltu, "No, get up, I'll finish what you want." Didi grabbed his penis and pulled him up. "Are you going to release the juices that are accumulated in your vagina?", Didi asked Paltu, laughing. Paltu hugged Didi and said, ‚ÄúYes Didi please!‚Äù

While Paltu was shaking his hand, Ruma suddenly grabbed her pussy and squeezed it in such a way that Paltu screamed in pain. His hard penis instantly became soft. Didi pushed him to the ground and said, laughing, ‚ÄúYes, yours has become soft! It‚Äôs okay, you can think about it tomorrow,‚Äù and after saying this, she left the bathroom laughing.
